# Computational-Vision---HDR-
Computational Vision (CS 484 final project)

High-dynamic range imaging(HDRI) is a method of reproducing greater dynamic range of luminosity than what is possible with standard digital imaging. Because the natural world contains a range of radiance values that is far greater than can be captured with any photographic sensor or film, any single exposure of a picture would contains saturated (overexposed) and dark (underexposed) regions. The aim of HDRI is to help create well-exposed photographs under challenging conditions such as extremely bright scenes. The common way of producing HDR image is to use pictures that was taken under a set of bracketed exposures, applying some transformation algorithm such as Debevec-Malik method to get the result HDR-image.
This repository includes a demonstration of HDR image production, in Jupyter notes and a final report.
